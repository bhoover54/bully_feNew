      <h3>Bully Free Schools</h3>
      <p className="">
       No student is allowed to abuse anyone else in a bully-free school. If an incident does occur, the abuser is immediately shut down before it happens again.  When students and parents come together and use The Bully Periscope, this is the new school  environment they can create by driving bullying out of the school

        Neighborhoods and communities want bully free schools for 4 main reasons:
        <ol>
          <li> To provide a much safer environment for children in their schools.</li>
          <li>To create an environment where children can thrive, socially and academically, learning to their fullest potential, without being afraid of anyone.</li>
          <li>To reap the financial rewards of living in a neighborhood with bully-free schools and the significant increase in property values gained from that. Bully-Free neighborhoods should also see a reduction in crime, especially domestic crime.</li>
          <li>Any responsible parent in todayâ€™s world would immediately seize an opportunity to have their children in a Bully-Free school</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p className="">Please, look at the Message to Moms video at the top of The Bully Periscope homepage with your children. Follow the instructions there and bullying in the school will cease very quickly.</p>
