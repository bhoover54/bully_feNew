            The Bully Periscope has its own bully, threat and weapons reporting system. When any bully strikes, go to the Bully Reporting Form tab and report the incident; 
            in fact, do this every time a bully strikes. In most cases reports are submitted for students by trusted adults. This provides 100% protection for the reporting student’s identity; 
            not even the principal knows who they are. Please click on the TRUSTED ADULTS tab to learn all details involved in being a trusted adult.
            Every bully report is downloaded in both the bully’s database as well as the school’s database. A copy of the bully report is sent to the principal with instructions to immediately 
            shut the abuse from this bully down.

              a step back and allow The Bully Periscope System to intervene and take over the situation. To do this take these 2 simple actions:
