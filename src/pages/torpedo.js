            The following procedures empowers every parent, from single parents to traditional parents and all other parents, to quickly end any abuse their child is enduring 
            from bullying at school, and to stop this harm completely on their own, without needing assistance, of any kind, from anyone. We call this action Torpedoing Your Bully.          
        </p>
        <p className="">
            <b>The First Time the Bully Strikes:</b>
        </p>
        <p className="">
            The Bully Periscope has its own bully, threat and weapons reporting system. When any bully strikes, go to the Bully Reporting Form tab and report the incident; 
            in fact, do this every time a bully strikes. In most cases reports are submitted for students by trusted adults. This provides 100% protection for the reporting student’s identity; 
            not even the principal knows who they are. Please click on the TRUSTED ADULTS tab to learn all details involved in being a trusted adult.
            Every bully report is downloaded in both the bully’s database as well as the school’s database. A copy of the bully report is sent to the principal with instructions to immediately 
            shut the abuse from this bully down.    
        </p>
        <p className="">
              <b>The Second Time the Bully Strikes:</b>
        </p>
        <p className="">
              If the bully strikes a second time, whether against your student or another student, this tells you that you are dealing with a repeat offender bully. This is a bully that abuses again and again. At this point you should take 
              a step back and allow The Bully Periscope System to intervene and take over the situation. To do this take these 2 simple actions:
        </p>
          <p className="">
              1st - File a 2nd bully report, just like you filed the first report. ALWAYS file a bully report.<br />
              2nd – Obtain a  Bully Periscope Report on your bully. This is your bully’s complete record of abusing and bullying others. 
              Once you have this Bully Periscope Report the information in the report will determine and dictate what actions you take next to shut down this abuse.<br />
              Please click <a href="/report-details"><b>HERE</b></a> to see a sample Bully Periscope Report and the valuable information that a Bully Periscope Report provides you.<br />
              Please click <a href="/periscope"><b>HERE</b></a> to order a Bully Periscope Report on your bully.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              After receiving the Bully Periscope Report on your bully, choose and click on which of the 3 situations below applies to you and then take the action provided:
          </p>
          <p className="">
              <b>Situation #1</b> - If The Bully Periscope Report shows that this bully has only been reported by you, your 2 reports are the only incidents against the bully please click <a href="/letter1"><b>HERE</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              <b>Situation #2</b> - The Bully Periscope Report shows that in addition to your 2 reports this bully has been reported one other time by someone else, making a total number of 3 
              reports against this bully please click <a href="/letter2"><b>HERE</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              <b>Situation #3</b> - The Bully Periscope Report shows that in addition to your 2 reports this bully has been reported for 2 or more other incidents of bullying, 
              making a total number of reports against this bully 4 or more please click <a href="/letter3"><b>HERE</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            <b>The Third Time the Bully Strikes:</b>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Very, very rarely does a bully strike again once The Bully Periscope is activated in second step above, however, if the bully does strikes again file a bully report on the incident, file a 
            3rd bully report on the  bully and then choose which of the 2 situations below applies to you and take the action provided for that situation:
          </p>
          <p className="">
              <b>Situation #1</b> – If you previously emailed letter #1 to the principal or letter #2 to the Superintendent and school board members please click <a href="/letter4"><b>HERE</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              <b>Situation #2</b> - You previously emailed letter #3 to the Superintendent and school board members please click <a href="/sit-3_2"><b>HERE</b></a>.
          </p>
                <p className="">
            <b>The Fourth Time the Bully Strikes:</b>
          </p>
          <p className="">
            When a bully strikes the 4th time they have exceeded the maximum amount of abuse incidents that parents are willing to allow. Your next course of action is either one or both of the choices below:       
          </p>
          <p className="">
            1 - Post all communications and letters along with the Bully Periscope Report for this bully on all social media so other parents and citizens are made aware of the dangerous levels of bullying that administrators are allowing in the schools and the level of neglect involving the handling of this particular bully.   
          </p>
          <p className="">
            2 - Provide all communications and letters along with the Bully Periscope Report for this bully to all local media outlets so the entire community is made aware of the dangerous levels of bullying that administrators are allowing in the schools and the level of neglect involving the handling of this particular bully.
          </p>                        
          <br /><br />
          <p className="">
              Long story short, now that a bully’s record of abusing others can no longer be kept secret and can be accessed and laid on the table for all to see, no school board will allow it’s 
              board members or their school district to be publicly disgraced on social media or local media so an undisciplined bully can continue to abuse other students. School boards will also not allow 
              one bully to drag the district deep into the legal liability swamp by repeatedly bullying others.
          </p>
          <p className="">
                Courts have significantly broadened the list of defendants that victims and their families can file 
              lawsuits against. In June, 2023 the family of Levi Creech, a 14 year old 9th grader from Benton, La. who was bullied to death at school, filed 17 separate lawsuits against the school district, some 
              of the school administrators individually as well as multiple parents of the bullies. This type of broad legal liability has become the norm when students have tragic outcomes from bullying. 
          </p>
          <p className="">
              In most cases what will happen is board members will give the directive that priority #1 is to shut down every bully before the situation reaches the point where any media gets involved 
              or there is any potential legal liability resulting from the bully’s abuse of others.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              The end result will be a bully free school environment protected and maintained by the “4 strikes and you’re out” standard. A bully-free school also offers the highest protection against 
              bullycides and revenge school shootings.
          </p>
          <p className="">
             The Bully Periscope is an independent, 3rd party system that functions automatically and completely on its own. Nobody, including town administrators or school administrators, has any type of authority or control over this system.
          </p>
          <p className="">
              If you feel that your school’s bully discipline policy is too lenient we provide an excellent Bully Discipline Policy that can be viewed on the BULLY PERISCOPE DISCIPLINE POLICY tab in the MORE section.

          <p className="">
              If you are the parent of a dating aged daughter The Bully Periscope can also be a valuable tool for you. Not all bullies abuse their girlfriends, but a very high number do. If you have suspicions or doubts about anyone that your daughter is dating, 
              get a Bully Periscope report on them and see if they have any history of abusing others.
