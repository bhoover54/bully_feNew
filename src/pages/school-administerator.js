      <h3>School Administrator</h3>
      <p>If your school is committed to providing a bully-free environment for your students, you and the other administrators will find this system to be very valuable. Here is how it works:</p>
      <p>All Bully Periscope reports are received by school administrators through their school email accounts.</p>
      <p>Any adult, 21 years of age or older, can file a bullying report, school shooter threat or weapon at school report as a trusted adult for a student.</p>
      <p>On that report will be the trusted adult’s name, email address and telephone number. When they file the report they also upload a verification video into The Bully Periscope database and the username for this verification video is also on the report.</p>
      <p>
        By typing in the username in the Search Videos tab under the MORE link on the thebullyperiscope.com home page, you can review the adult’s video which will allow you to see their face and hear their voice. This eliminates fake or fraudulent reporting. If you find yourself in an urgent or emergency
        situation where you need an immediate, face to face verification with the person filing the report, contact the person through their cell phone and use FaceTime to immediately I.D. and verify them. The ability to immediately access and verify the person filing the report can easily mean life
        or death when addressing a bombing threat, school shooting threat or any other emergency threat against the school.
      </p>
      <p>Once you have reviewed the report, if you have follow up questions you can contact the adult trustee and they will act as a liaison between you and the student and provide the answers you need.</p>
      <p>
        One thing Administrators should be constantly reminded of; The Bully Periscope has been activated for your school because the community around the school, who actually owns the school, has decided that they want a bully free school for 3 main reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>To provide a much safer environment for their children in their school</li>
          <li>To create a new environment in the school that is happier, brighter and much more conducive to learning allowing students to be educated at a much higher and far more effective level.</li>
          <li>To reap the financial rewards of living in a neighborhood with bully-free schools and the significant increase in property values gained from that.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Bully-Free to your community means no student is repeatedly abused by anyone in your school. If it does happen once it is immediately shut down before it happens again. This is the standard that the community has set.</p>
      <p>
        Here is a checklist of suggestions that we recommend for administrators to utilize to help transition students over to attending a Bully Periscope protected, bully-free school. Hold an assembly and tell all the students these things:
        <ul>
          <li>The community has decided to make the school bully free and the BullyBloxx system has been activated to accomplish this. Explain what bully-free means.</li>
          <li>Explain to the students how the system works and make sure that every one understands the one rule of conduct that will protect them from having any bullying issues; “keep your hands and your words to yourself”. Just do that one thing and there will be no problems.</li>
          <li>Explain to the students that if any of them think they are above the rules of bullying, they will quickly find themselves attending alternative school. There is just no avoiding it, explain to them why.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What administrators should recognize is this; once a student accumulates more than 3 bully reports, the potential liability to the school from the bully’s mis-behavior quickly compounds. Any tragedy that can be linked to a bully’s abuse where the bully has been reported numerous times to
        administrators can easily result in staggering damages awarded against the school. It is also worth noting that it is obvious, by the large amounts of damages that are being awarded, that our courts want this bullying in schools to stop. Our courts see the damage to our society from this
        bullying and they support ending it, especially local courts. With this as a guide, the best thing to do is to adopt a firm bully discipline policy like the one The Bully Periscope provides and enforce it. If a student refuses to keep their hands and their words to themselves, they are going to expel
        themselves simply by the numbers of incidents they will get reported for. No student can have an unlimited number of bullying strikes, there has to be a red line. Of course, school administrators must investigate to confirm the accusation of bullying and it will be their decision as to
        whether it is or not; nothing has changed there. At The Bully Periscope we believe that our laws in America ensures every student an opportunity for a safe place to learn, but the student must display a certain level of self-control and behavior in order to utilize this safe place to learn. We
        believe it is not guaranteed, it must be earned with proper behavior including not abusing others.
