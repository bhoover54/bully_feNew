        ________________ Date <br /><br />
        Dear Superintendent and School Board Members, <br /><br />
        I am sending you this letter as a follow up to the two bully reports that I have filed against ____________________(the bully) with __________________ (Principal). Please find enclosed a copy of ____________________’s (the bully) Periscope Report showing that in addition to my 2 reports this 
        bully has been reported one other time by someone else, making a total number of 3 reports against this bully.
        <br /><br />
        Please accept this letter as notification if ____________________(the bully)  strikes again and is allowed to continue attending classes on campus while abusing others after a 4th report is filed I will, at that point, be out of good options and  I will have no other choice but to utilize 
        social media and local news media to display copies of the Bully Periscope Report on this bully along with all communications between myself and school administrators to inform our community members of the level of neglect present in the school when addressing bullies and their abuse. 
        I may also contact a personal injury attorney, turn over all Periscope Reports and communications between us to them, and let them take over this issue and end the abuse from this bully.
        <br /><br />
        In closing I ask you to please bring ____________________(the bully) in and take whatever actions are necessary to end their abuse so no further actions will be necessary on this end. If I can be of assistance in any way in this matter please feel free to contact me.
        <br /><br /> 
        Sincerely,
      </p>
