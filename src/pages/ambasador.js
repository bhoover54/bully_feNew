      <h2>Bully Shutdown Ambassadors</h2>
      <p>
        Hello and congratulations on becoming a Bully Shutdown Ambassador. By stepping forward you are not only providing a very critical service to your community, you are also creating new relationships with the thousands of families connected to your school/schools. This is what makes Bully
        Shutdown Ambassador positions lead generating machines for agents.
      </p>
      <p>Ambassadors receive very interesting and informative articles from BullyBloxx every 3-4 weeks by email. Ambasadors have only one responsibility; to post this information on all of their social media accounts for the parents of the school and members of the community to see.</p>
      <p>
        Below is a sample of the initial article posted by all Ambassadors, it introduces you and BullyBloxx to the community. As you see in this sample, the name of the sample school is Kex Middle School, the agent is Jordan Guinn and the agency is Emma Watkins Realty of Camak Texas. Of course you
        will want to substitute your information and your school’s information for this. The heading of your posting on your social media should be “ATTENTION: All Kex Middle School Parents” (again, substituting your school’s name for Kex Middle School)
        <br />
        There are 2 way that you can post this information on your social media:
        <ol>
          <li>You can simply copy and paste this notice on your social media for the parents and community members to see.</li>
          <li>
            If you want to establish a much stronger and more personal relationship with the community, you can create a power point presentation like the one on the Real Estate Pros tab on the BollyBloxx home page using your voice and photograph. This method will be much more beneficial to your
            business and for a very small fee you can find media companies on Fiverr who will create these powerpoint presentations for you. It is well worth the costs and highly recommended. Here is the initial posting:

        Hi, I am Jordan Guinn of Emma Watkins Realty in Camak, Texas. If you are a Kex Middle School parent or a member of the Kex Middle School community please allow me to also introduce myself as the Bully Shutdown Ambassador for Kex Middle School. Kex Middle School students are now protected by
        a new, state of the art system called BullyBloxx that quickly shuts down bullying and by doing so virtually eliminates the possibility of a school shooting or bullycide. <br />
        BullyBloxx is a highly effective, parent run, community funded school shooter and bullying shut down system that absolutely works. BullyBloxx is very inexpensive to provide for the students, costing only $75 per week for any school no matter how large, which is pennies compared to the
        thousands of dollars per month that many of today’s failed anti-bullying systems charge. Please go to bullybloxx.com and review the WHAT IS BULLYBLOXX main video and then watch the Message to Moms video with your child.
        <br />
        This system is fully operational, right now as we speak, providing all of its protections for Kex Middle School students. BullyBloxx is providing this system free for 45 days to allow the community time to provide the funds to support it for the first year.
        <br />
        Once you have reviewed this system and seen how quickly and effectively it shuts down bullying, ask yourself, would our Kex Middle School students be safer with or without BullyBloxx. If you agree that this is a “must have system” for our students at Kex Middle School, please click on the
        DONATE FOR YOUR SCHOOL tab on the bullybloxx.com home page and donate to fund this very important protection for our Kex Middle School students.
        <br />
        If you have children in other schools, please go to bullybloxx.com and see how to quickly get them and their schools protected by this system. And please, share this on all of your social media so parents in all of our schools can be aware of this protection for their children.
        <br />
        Of course, if you have any real estate needs I am always here to serve you. Please text or call me at 992-543-3763 or email me at jguinn96@emmawatkinsrealty.com Thank you
        <br />
        Posting this initial notice is all that you do to get everything started remembering that the heading of this post on your social media should be “ATTENTION: All Kex Middle School Parents” (again, substituting your school’s name for Kex Middle School).
        <br />
        Within a few weeks you will receive another article of interest to the parents and community to post, again strengthening your bond with all parents in the school and members of the community. Thanks again for your service to your community.
