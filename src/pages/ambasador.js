      <h2>Bully Shutdown Ambassadors</h2>
      <p>
        Hello and congratulations on becoming a Bully Shutdown Ambassador. <br /> If you are a Band Booster Club Parent please leave this page, go to the MORE tab and then click on the Band Booster Club Parents tab. If you are a Real Estate pro,{" "}
        <Link to="/band-booster">continue reading here. </Link>
        <br /> <br /> By stepping forward you are not only providing a very critical service to your community, you are also creating new relationships with the thousands of families connected to your school/schools. This is what makes Bully Shutdown Ambassador positions lead generating machines for
        agents.
      </p>
      <p>Ambassadors receive very interesting and informative articles from The Bully Periscope every 3-4 weeks by email. Ambasadors have only one responsibility; to post this information on all of their social media accounts for the parents of the school and members of the community to see.</p>
      <p>
        Below is a sample of the initial article posted by all Ambassadors, it introduces you and The Bully Periscope to the community. As you see in this sample, the name of the sample school is Kex Middle School, the agent is Jordan Guinn and the agency is Emma Watkins Realty of Camak Texas. Of course you
        will want to substitute your information and your school’s information for this. The heading of your posting on your social media should be “ATTENTION: All Kex Middle School Parents” (again, substituting your school’s name for Kex Middle School)
        <br />
        There are 2 way that you can post this information on your social media:
        <ol>
          <li>You can simply copy and paste this notice on your social media for the parents and community members to see.</li>
          <li>
            If you want to establish a much stronger and more personal relationship with the community, you can create a power point presentation like the one on the Real Estate Pros tab on the BollyBloxx home page using your voice and photograph. This method will be much more beneficial to your
            business and for a very small fee you can find media companies on Fiverr who will create these powerpoint presentations for you. It is well worth the costs and highly recommended. Here is the initial posting:

        Hi, I am Jordan Guinn of Emma Watkins Realty in Camak, Texas. If you are a Kex Middle School parent or a member of the Kex Middle School community please allow me to also introduce myself as the Bully Shutdown Ambassador for Kex Middle School. Kex Middle School students are now protected by
        a new, state of the art system called The Bully Periscope that quickly shuts down bullying and by doing so virtually eliminates the possibility of a school shooting or bullycide. <br />
        The Bully Periscope is a highly effective, parent run, community funded school shooter and bullying shut down system that absolutely works. The Bully Periscope is very inexpensive to provide for the students, costing only $75 per week for any school no matter how large, which is pennies compared to the
        thousands of dollars per month that many of today’s failed anti-bullying systems charge. Please go to thebullyperiscope.com and review the WHAT IS THE BULLY PERISCOPE main video and then watch the Message to Moms video with your child.
        <br />
        This system is fully operational, right now as we speak, providing all of its protections for Kex Middle School students. The Bully Periscope is providing this system free for 45 days to allow the community time to provide the funds to support it for the first year.
        <br />
        Once you have reviewed this system and seen how quickly and effectively it shuts down bullying, ask yourself, would our Kex Middle School students be safer with or without The Bully Periscope. If you agree that this is a “must have system” for our students at Kex Middle School, please click on the
        DONATE FOR YOUR SCHOOL tab on the thebullyperiscope.com home page and donate to fund this very important protection for our Kex Middle School students.
        <br />
        If you have children in other schools, please go to thebullyperiscope.com and see how to quickly get them and their schools protected by this system. And please, share this on all of your social media so parents in all of our schools can be aware of this protection for their children.
        <br />
        Of course, if you have any real estate needs I am always here to serve you. Please text or call me at 992-543-3763 or email me at jguinn96@emmawatkinsrealty.com Thank you
        <br />
        Posting this initial notice is all that you do to get everything started remembering that the heading of this post on your social media should be “ATTENTION: All Kex Middle School Parents” (again, substituting your school’s name for Kex Middle School).
        <br />
        Within a few weeks you will receive another article of interest to the parents and community to post, again strengthening your bond with all parents in the school and members of the community. Thanks again for your service to your community.
        <br />
        You should post this initial statement at least 2 times a week for at least 5 weeks on all of your social media to be sure that every parent in the school knows about this protection.
