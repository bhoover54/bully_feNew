      <h3>BullyBloxx Quick Summary</h3>
  {/*<p>The BullyBloxx system was specifically created to end three epidemics; bullying, bullycides and rampage school shootings. These epidemics are devastating the lives of our young people and restraining their educational systems at very low levels.</p>
      <p>
        The parents and citizens in the community completely own and have total authority over the BullyBloxx system. When a community implements BullyBloxx for its schools, it is in reality doing 2 different things:
        <ol>
          <li>It is sending school officials a new regulation for bullying that sets a specific limit on the number of offenses a bully can have before expulsion from school ( usually expulsion is on the 4th offense).</li>
          <li>It is also informing school officials that BullyBloxx provides parents/citizens full access to all bully reports to ensure that every bully report is correctly and properly investigated with every bully being held 100% accountable to this new regulation, without exception.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once BullyBloxx is activated for a school, the bullies there have only 2 options to choose from: <br />
        Option1- They can stop abusing others immediately, completely and permanently.
        <br />
        OR
        <br />
        Option2 - They can continue abusing others, quickly exceeding the maximum number of allowed offenses, and then be removed from the campus and transferred to alternative school or home school.
      </p>
      <p>
        BullyBloxx never refuses to activate the system for any school district. BullyBloxx doesn’t charge a direct fee for using the system. The cost of providing BullyBloxx is funded by contributions from the community. Once BullyBloxx is activated in a school district everyone in the community
        benefits in one way or another. Families without children in school see a significant increase in property values; the community becomes a much more peaceful place to live and attracts quality families from other place. Any responsible parent in today’s world would immediate seize an
        opportunity to have their children in a bully-free school. Each individual citizen contributes whatever amount they choose based on the benefit that BullyBloxx brings to them and their family.
