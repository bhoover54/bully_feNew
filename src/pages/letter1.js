        <strong> Principal’s letter</strong> – <br /> If you are reporting the same bully for a 2nd time, email the letter below to the principal.

        ________________ Date <br />
        Dear ________________(Principal), <br />
        I am sending you this letter as a follow up to the two reports I have filed against “Billy Bully” (the bully). Please accept this letter as notification if “Billy Bully” strikes again and a 3rd report is necessary I will take the following actions:
        <br />
        I will utilize The Periscope feature in the BullyBloxx database and obtain the information from every bully report that has been filed by anyone against “Billy Bully”. I will then send a copy of this letter with The Periscope Reports attached, as well as all communications between you and I
        to all school board members and the Superintendent of the district.
        <br />
        Please understand that this letter is my attempt to get this abuse stopped before stronger measures are demanded. After contacting the superintendent and school board members, if this abuse is allowed to continue, I will have no other choice but to contact a personal injury attorney, turn
        over all Periscope Reports and communications between us to them and let them take over this issue and end the abuse from this bully.
        <br />
        In closing I ask you to please bring “Billy Bully” in and take whatever actions are necessary to end their abuse so none of these actions listed in this letter will be necessary. If I can be of assistance in any way in this matter please feel free to contact me.
        <br /> Sincerely,
      </p>
