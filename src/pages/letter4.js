        ________________ Date <br /><br />
        Dear Superintendent and School Board Members, <br /><br />
        I am sending you this letter as a follow up to the three bully reports that I have filed against ____________________(the bully) with __________________ (Principal). Please find enclosed a copy of ___________________’s (the bully) Periscope Report showing that in addition to my 2 reports this bully has been 
        reported for 2 or more other incidents of bullying, making a total number of reports against this bully 4 or more. 
        <br /><br />
        This bully has now exceeded the acceptable number of bully abuses committed against others in a calendar school year (3) and they must be addressed with their bullying immediately shut down.  Failure to do so will leave me with no other choice but to utilize social media and local news media to display copies of the 
        Bully Periscope Report on this bully along with all communications between myself and school administrators to inform our community members of the level of neglect present in the school when addressing bullies and their abuse. I may also contact a personal injury attorney, turn over all Periscope Reports and 
        communications between us to them, and let them take over this issue and end the abuse from this bully.
        <br /><br />
        In closing I ask you to please bring ____________________(the bully) in and take whatever actions are necessary to end their abuse so no further actions will be necessary on this end. If I can be of assistance in any way in this matter please feel free to contact me.
        <br /><br /> 
        Sincerely,
      </p>
