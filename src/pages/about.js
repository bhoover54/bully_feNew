      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>My name is Mack Galphin and I led in the development of The Bully Periscope. Neighborhoods and communities want bully free schools for 4 main reasons:</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>To provide a much safer environment for children in their schools.</li>
          <li> To create an environment where children can thrive, socially and academically, without being afraid of anyone.</li>
          <li>To reap the financial rewards of living in a neighborhood with bully-free schools and the significant increase in property values gained from that. Bully-Free neighborhoods should also see a reduction in crime, especially domestic crime.</li>
          <li>Any responsible parent in today’s world would immediately seize an opportunity to have their children in a Bully-Free school.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The question we are asked most is what does “bully-free” schools mean; our answer is this. To most parents and citizens it means no student is allowed to abuse anyone in their school. If an incident does occur, the abuser is immediately addressed and shut down before it happens again. This
        is the bully-free standard that most communities set and the standard that The Bully Periscope provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communities are demanding a system that quickly shuts down the abuse, school shootings and suicides because of bullying; and keeps them shut down. We developed The Bully Periscope to fill this need for communities who are making their schools bully-free. This The Bully Periscopes system is very fair to
        students, parents and administrators alike, but it is also very firm for all involved. With BulllyBloxx everybody is accountable for their behavior towards others, as it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a group of parents, educators, retired educators, intellectuals and others who agree that the systems that we have in place today to protect our children are not working; bullying, school shootings and bullycides gets worse in our schools every day. We believe that the direct and
        extended damage that bullying is doing to our society is immense and a major cause of the division of our people in our country; that some type of action must take place now, we can’t watch this happen and do nothing any longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that the victims of bullying have no responsibility of any kind in stopping the abuse; that is the responsibility of all others except the victims, with the parents of the bully and school administrators leading the way. The victims should only be asked to do one thing………REPORT
        THE BULLIES. And all other witnesses should report them as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        We know that bullies suffer greatly from their own behavior, in fact bullies are 4 times more likely to be in jail before 21 years of age, HOWEVER, we do not see any advantage to the bully or anyone else by allowing the abuse to continue. We see the first step for everyone involved is to
        immediately shut down all bullying and then the bully, his/her parents and school administrators can work to help the bully change their behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        By allowing the epidemic levels of bullying in our schools today we are teaching our children to abuse even those who they spend their lives with, those who are closest to them and that bleeds over into every part of their lives. Bullying is a 100% learned behavior, all these bullies in
        schools were taught by someone, they weren’t born bullies. The good thing is a learned behavior like bullying can also be unlearned and that is one of the things that The Bully Periscope does, it unlearns bullying behavior with one simple rule that we call The James Wilson Rule of Discipline, please
        allow me to explain:
      </p>

      <p>
        A man named James Wilson was my first black teacher and a great influence on me, first as a student and later as a board member at his school. What I learned from him was invaluable in developing this The Bully Periscope system. I met him when our schools integrated in 1970 in Ninety Six, S.C. Ninety
        Six was a small, uneducated, openly racist, cotton mill town in the South Carolina upstate that was about 60% white. When the schools were forced to integrate, I was with the first group of white students to attend Edgewood School which was previously the black school. With integration it
        was now the Middle School for about 300 students; I was in the 7th grade. Coach Wilson was the boys P.E. teacher and every boy in the school, about 150 of us, had class with him every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was a former Marine boxing champ and about 35 years old. He was a superior athlete and nobody in the school could compete with him. He was the school’s disciplinarian for all the boys, you got in trouble you went to him. On day #1 of integration he gave every boy in that school one rule
        to follow, a very simple rule; ”keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”. With that one simple rule he intended to peacefully integrate a middle school in a small, openly racist South Carolina mill town, and he did just that. The truth is, we had a ball, both black and white. There was
        always lots of fun and laughing out loud; we became friends and we are still friends today.
      </p>

      <p>
        The James Wilson Rule of Discipline still works just as effectively today, there is no abuse when kids keep their hands and their mouths to themselves. Of course we are much softer today than we were in 1970 so the rule today is “keep your hands and words to yourself”. At The Bully Periscope we
        believe that it is time for all communities to tell all of their bullies in all of their schools exactly what Coach James Wilson told all of us boys on day #1 of integrating the schools way back in sept of 1970 in Ninety Six, S.C. He said ”you are going to keep your hands and your mouth to
        yourself”, and he meant it and our communities need to mean it too. We as communities need to make it very clear that those students who can’t keep their hands and their mouths to themselves can attend school at Alternative School until they learn how. These communities can utilize the
        The Bully Periscope system to establish this rule and by doing so make their schools bully-free.

        A man named James Wilson was my first black teacher and a great influence on me, first as a student and later as a board member at his school......... What I learned from him was invaluable in developing this The Bully Periscope system. I met him when our schools integrated in 1970 in Ninety Six,
        S.C. Ninety Six was a small, uneducated, openly racist, cotton mill town. Student ratio was about 60% white. When the schools were forced to integrate I was with the first group of white students to attend Edgewood School which was previously the black school and now the Middle School for
        about 300 students; I was in the 7 th grade. Coach Wilson was the boys P.E. teacher and every boy in the school had class with him every day. He was a former Marine boxing champ and about 35 years old. He was a superior athlete and nobody in the school could compete with him. He was the

        will work today......let’s stop addressing the victims and let’s address the bullies for a change.........bullying is not the victim’s problem to solve.........in fact, victims have no way of solving the bullying problem.........the only one who can solve the bullying problem is the bully
        and we at The Bully Periscope believe that it is time for all communities to tell all of their bullies in all of their schools exactly what Coach James Wilson told all of us boys on day #1 of integrating the schools...... way back in sept of 1970......in Ninety Six, S.C...............He said ”you are
        going to keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”........and when the community tells the bullies this, mean it......just like Coach Wilson did................. The Bully Periscope gives the community the ability and the option to enforce Coach Wilson’s rule on every bully..............personally,
        i think it’s the answer..........and I have seen it work...that is why I developed The Bully Periscope....”keep your hands and your mouth to yourself”.........it’s really simple.........except today, 52 years later, we say..........”keep your hands and your words to yourself”....... Every community
        makes it’s own decision on bully-free schools. Communities that desire bully-free schools have The Bully Periscope to help achieve that. The Bully Periscope provides the school administrators with a system that gets bullying reported and the support of the community to shut it down after it’s reported.
