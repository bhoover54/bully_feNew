/*If you are a real estate professional, thanks to BullyBloxx, you alone have the ability to transform your community into a bully free community for all students K-12. BullyBloxx allows you to serve as a Bully Shutdown Ambassador for up to 3 schools meaning that you alone can make your
          community’s elementary school, middle school and high school all bully-free. BullyBloxx also makes the exception for you to serve as a Bully Shutdown Ambassador for a 4th school if your community has a Jr. High School or 4th school of any type. The market desirability and value of every
          home skyrockets when their students have bully-free schools to attend.
          <br />
          <br />
          Make a difference, make your community’s schools bully-free and be the face of that bully-free community. This is not only an incredibly noble thing to do for your community, it is also very good for your business. To view information video on the value to you, your community and your
